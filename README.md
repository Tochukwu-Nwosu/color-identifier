# Color-identifier

Can you guess a color by its `rgb` value? This project is a `color-identifier` game that tests your knowledge on `rgb` color values.

## What is RGB?

- r - Red
- g - Green
- b - Blue

An RGB color value is specified with: `rgb(red, green, blue)`.

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.

For example, `rgb(0, 0, 255)` is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

## Instruction

Random colors will be generated and an RGB value will be displayed for you.
Select the color that matches the displayed RGB value by clicking on any of the available color options.
You can reset the game by clicking the on reset button.
You can switch from dark mode to light and vice versa by clicking the moon icon at the top-right-corner of your screen.
